<p>Hi, Everyone! I apologize again for missing many of your intros today and look forward to reading your written versions on Blackboard.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I am a former Elementary school Social Studies teacher (2nd/3rd grade) with an interest in helping teachers bring more digital tools and resources into the classroom. I believe bringing technology into more Humanities lesson plans will engage students who may have dreaded reading/writing-heavy classes. Also, the important skills of data analysis and visualization apply across school subjects (and life!), even for young learners. I hope to make the development of such skills less intimidating for teachers and students who don't feel particularly "tech-savvy" themselves. In pursuit of this goal, I am on a Generalist track, trying to take a variety of School Library Media and Data Science courses.</p>
<p id ="interests">My personal interests include:</p>
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction2()">Change title of bulleted list</button>
	<ul>
		<li>jigsaw puzzles</li>
		<li>cooking (if it's not too complicated)</li>
		<li>reading (especially historical fiction)</li>
		<li>TV shows (also historical, or crime-based--I highly recommend <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80074249">The Last Kingdom</a> on Netflix)
		<li>taking long walks outside (especially with my <em>almost</em> one-year-old son!)</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
<div id="foot">
<p>I look forward to working with you all this semester!</p>
