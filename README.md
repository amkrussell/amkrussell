Hi, Iâ€™m @amkrussell!

Iâ€™m an MLIS candidate interested in digital resources for the K-12 classroom. I'm currently learning javascript and working with LibGuides.

Iâ€™m on GitHub to learn about how it works for a "Data on the Web" course. I'm interested in how it's being used for curation and its additional potential to 
support the efforts of libraries, cultural heritage institutions, and schools.
